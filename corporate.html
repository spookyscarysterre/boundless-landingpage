              </ul>
            </li>
            <li class="fst-italic">Font choices</li>
			  <p>For the logo and headlines we found a bold, dynamic font (Horizon) with a modern, geometric style to reflect the brand's sense of energy and movement with regard to expats traveling and stepping out of their comfort zone. All-caps lettering can work well to emphasize the brand's name and make it stand out. For the body text we will use fonts such as Tomorrow to create a traditional look that is easy to read and professional.&nbsp;</p>
            <li class="fst-italic">User interface patterns (e.g. grids, carousels, menu organizations etc.)</li>
			  <p>The grids provide a structured layout for content, making it easy for users to scan and navigate through the website. Carousels are being used to showcase multiple pieces of content in a single space, which is useful for highlighting featured products or services, in this case pubquizzes. The use of carousels is based on the principle of movement, which can draw users' attention and increase engagement. The menu organization is critical to website navigation, as it helps users quickly find the information they are looking for. Effective menu organization is based on principles of hierarchy and clarity, making it easy for users to understand the structure of the website and locate the information they need. </p>
            <li class="fst-italic">The structure of the <strong>navigation and content</strong> (e.g. how content units are distributed across pages)</li>
		    <p>The content on the website is distributed across different pages. This makes it more convenient for users to find the information they are looking for because it is split up into different categories. In the menu on our home page, you can navigate to the ‚Äúabout us‚Äù and ‚Äúpub quizzes‚Äù page through a drop-down menu. The corporate page and Instagram link are also accessible from the home page.</p>
            
            <li class="fst-italic">Please relate these elements to other units, for example:
              <ul>
                <li>How does website design fit the <strong>values and personality of the brand</strong>?</li>
			    <p>The design of a website reflects the values and personality of the brand in order to create a consistent and cohesive user experience. This is achieved through the use of brand colors, typography, imagery, and tone of voice. </p>
                <li>How does website design fit the <strong>marketing and communication strategy</strong>?</li>
			    <p>The layout of a website helps to forward desired actions and effectively convey essential messages in support of the marketing and communication strategy. This is accomplished by using calls-to-action, clear and engaging language, and graphic components that complement the main marketing message. </p>
				  
				  
                <li>How does website design help showcase the <strong>unique value proposal of the product</strong>?</li>
				  <p>The website helps showcase the unique value proposal of the product. For example, the use of imagery that depicts people from different cultures coming together to enjoy quiz events can help convey the brand's unique value proposition.</p>

          <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
          <p> Introducing the Boundless Campaign: Connecting Expats, Creating Opportunities. Our brand, Boundless, is built on the concept of infinite possibility and opportunity. We understand the difficulties that expats encounter while looking for connections outside of their native country, and we are here to help.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Our campaign is intrinsically tied to our essential concept, resulting in a seamless integration of our brand values and the demands of expats all over the world. Boundless suggests a sense of limitless potential and opportunity, which could be appealing to expats who are looking for a way to find and maintain connections outside of their home country.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>The word "boundless" also suggests a sense of openness and inclusivity, which could reflect the brand's commitment to helping expats from all backgrounds thrive abroad. As a brand we focus on helping expats maintaining relationships and connections, especially for expats who may be far away from their loved ones. We want to facilitate a fun and engaging way for expats to create new connections, for friends to reconnect, and create new shared memories and experiences through our PubQuizes. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As a brand we focus on helping expats maintaining relationships and connections, especially for expats who may be far away from their loved ones. We want to facilitate a fun and engaging way for expats to create new connections, for friends to reconnect, and create new shared memories and experiences through our PubQuizes. &nbsp; </p>
			<p>To promote our brand and create awareness for our website, we developed a comprehensive social media strategy focused primarily on Instagram. With its visual format and strong community of expats and travelers, Instagram is a natural fit for our brand. To bring this strategy to life a content calendar was created. By doing this we got a good view of what the promotional activities were going to look like. In the first part of our campaign our goal was to create a sense of curiosity about our brand and its concept by posting 2-3 times a week on Instagram. We did this by sharing high quality images and graphics with teaser taglines and quotes that hint at our brand‚Äôs values and mission. Using relevant hashtags will attract new followers and increase our reach. The second part we focused on introducing our brand, its concept, and values by posting once a day on Instagram. We used clear and concise messaging that explains what our brand is all about and what makes us unique. By using persuasive language, we tried to get our target audience excited about our brand. In the third part we included a call to action to get our target audience to visit our website and engage with our brand further. Finally, we started posting consistently every day and building customer relationships. </p>
			<p>&nbsp;The marketing campaign effectively emphasizes the concept of limitless potential and opportunity, as well as the brand's commitment to openness and inclusivity. The campaign represents the Boundless concept by encouraging interactions and assisting expats in maintaining relationships via exciting PubQuizes. It generates curiosity and excitement through high-quality content and, daily postings and customer relationship-building match with the brand's promise to being a dependable companion for expats. Overall, the campaign's strategic features and activities perfectly blend with the Boundless theme, generating a sense of endless possibilities and fostering meaningful connections for expats worldwide. </p>
		  <p>In summary, the Boundless brand's campaign and promotional activities include a comprehensive social media strategy focused on Instagram, sharing authentic and relatable content. These activities are designed to achieve the brand's reach, affect and response objectives. Firstly, in terms of its reach objective of increasing brand awareness among expat communities by 15% within the first 4 weeks of launch, Instagram is a highly effective channel for reaching a broad audience. By using hashtags, collaborating with influencers and other brands, and sharing engaging content, the Boundless brand can increase its visibility and reach more expats who may be interested in its services.&nbsp;</p>
		  <p>Secondly, in terms of its response objective of increasing website traffic and conversion rate by 25% within the first 4 weeks of launch, Instagram can be used to drive traffic to the brand's website. By including links to the website in posts and stories, the brand can encourage followers to visit the site and engage with its content. This can ultimately lead to increased conversions and customer satisfaction.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Thirdly, in terms of its affect objective of increasing positive brand sentiment among expats by 20% within the first 4 weeks of launch, Instagram is an ideal platform for sharing authentic and relatable stories and experiences from other expats. By sharing content that resonates with its target audience, the brand can establish a sense of community and trust, which can ultimately lead to a more positive brand sentiment. </p>

Defining clear objectives: By setting clear objectives for our campaign, we established measurable goals and metrics to track our progress and success. This helped us identify what is working and what is not and adjust your strategy accordingly.  

Boosting creativity and innovation: Developing a unique and creative campaign through brainstorming and ideation sessions, generated fresh ideas and approaches.  

Instagram algorithms: As we posted our content on Instagram, we tried several different options like posting in the morning, afternoon or evening, and using different kinds of hashtags. Looking at the statistics we see how it affects the response to our posts. One thing that stands out is that the content posted in the morning got the most interaction and likes.   </p>
          <h4 id="marketing-5" class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
          <p>Looking back at the campaign so far, it was a decent combination of quality content and messaging and consistency of posting. Although we could have tried to engage more with the audience by making more use of stories, polls and questions to make it more interactive. Beyond the first start of our campaign, we will continue to create engaging content that aligns with our brand values and resonates with our target audience.</p>
          <p>New objective: To build a strong and loyal community around our brand by consistently creating valuable content and engaging with our audience.  </p>
          <p>The content calendar for the future includes: </p>
		  <p> Week 1: Evoking curiosity - We will create a sense of curiosity about our brand and its concept by posting 2-3 times a week on Instagram. We will share high-quality images or graphics with teaser taglines or quotes that hint at our brand's values and mission. Using relevant hashtags will attract new followers and increase our reach. In our stories, we will share a poll or survey asking our followers to guess what our brand's concept or mission is. Sharing the results at the end of the day will encourage further engagement and discussion in the comments.&nbsp;</p>
		  <p>Week 2: Getting to know the brand - In the second week, we will introduce our brand, its concept, and values by posting once a day on Instagram. We will use clear and concise messaging that explains what our brand is all about and what makes us unique. By using persuasive language, we will aim to get our target audience excited about our brand.&nbsp;</p>
		  <p>Week 3: Creating Engagement - In the third week, we will create engagement by sharing posts on Instagram that create excitement around how our concept works and upcoming events. We will share facts and quotes to inform and educate our audience about our brand. We will include a call to action to get our target audience to visit our website and engage with our brand further.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Week 4: Building Customer Relations - This week, we will focus on building customer relations by engaging with our audience on Instagram. We will respond to comments and messages on social media, encourage user-generated content, and showcase customer success stories. By measuring the number of website visits, social media likes, shares, and comments, we will track our reach objective. We will also conduct surveys and polls to gather feedback and insights from our target audience, which will help us improve our brand and better serve our customers. &nbsp;</p>
<h4 id="marketing-6" class="mt-4">Professionalism</h4>
         <p>Our Instagram grid has a combination of graphics, photos, and catchy texts. This makes it look interesting and playful. We decided to use warm colors like shades of orange and purple because they represent our brand and create a feeling of warmth and inclusion.  

Increase brand awareness among expat communities by 15% within the first four weeks of launch. 

Reach a minimum of 2000 social media followers on our platforms within the first year of launch.

          <h4 id="management-2" class="mt-2">Validation of Assumptions</h4>
          <p>While designing our brand Boundless a willingness to do pub quizes was assumed. The reason for this was because according to the problem interviews we conducted with expats, a lot of expats experience loneliness and homesickness and have a desire to either reconnect with their community from home or find new ways to connect and find a new community in the country they moved to. Besides this we also researched these topics. After finishing the design of our brand, we conducted solution interviews to get expats‚Äô opinions on it. In these interviews they validated our assumptions and pointed out that they do indeed like the idea of having fun, making connections and bringing people together by doing pub quizes.</p>
